**PROJECT ABSTRACT:**<br>
This project is a Django-based web application that allows users to submit details related to book purchases, including personal information and order specifics. The form captures key data such as the userâ€™s name, contact number, address, book details, and the total amount paid. Once the user submits the form, the information is validated, saved to the database, and displayed on a result page.<br>

**Key features:**<br>
**1.Data Capture:** The form collects essential details such as name, contact number, address, book title, the number of books purchased, and the total amount.<br>
**2.Data Validation:** Checks are in place to ensure all required fields (name, contact, address, books, amount, and the number of books) are provided before saving<br>
**3.Database Storage:** Collected data is stored in a MySQL (or other supported) database using Django's ORM.<br>
**4.Result Display:** Upon successful submission, the entered data is displayed on a result page, confirming the transaction.<br>
**5.Error Handling:** If any required fields are missing, the system returns a response indicating the issue.<br>
This project demonstrates a simple form submission workflow in Django, including request handling, data validation, saving to a database, and rendering user-provided data back to the user. It is an excellent introduction to basic CRUD operations and form handling in web applications.<br>
